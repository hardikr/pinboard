CLI script for accessing Pinboard

##Introduction
A command-line script to access Pinboard. Eventually I want to get this into the [holman/boom](https://github.com/holman/boom) gem :) (well, at least my fork of it). Really need to keep track of my favorite gifs on Pinboard too, and this seems like a good way of achieving it.

##Install/Use
	$ gem install highline
	$ wget https://raw.github.com/hardikr/pinboard/master/pinboard.rb
	$ ruby pinboard.rb
	
##Acknowledgements
Uses code from the wonderful [Pinboard gem](https://github.com/ryw/pinboard).

##Major Long-Term To-do
Package into a gem like the original [Pinboard gem](https://github.com/ryw/pinboard).
